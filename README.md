## Fork / Credits
This is a continuation of the [github.com/d5/tengo](https://github.com/d5/tengo) project starting of this [pull request](https://github.com/d5/tengo/pull/330) implementing go routines and channels. Special thanks goes to [d5](https://github.com/d5/) for his work on the tengo language and [Bai-Yingjie](https://github.com/Bai-Yingjie) for implementing the foundation of concurrency while retaining the original tests of the project.
